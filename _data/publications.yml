    Cognitive control training with domain-general response inhibition
    does not change children’s brains or behavior.
  description: >
    My first Nature Neuroscience paper! We explain the outcomes of a 
    long-term brain training study, and find that -essentially- there 
    weren't many effects.

    Neurocognitive basis of model-based decision making and its 
    metacontrol in childhood
  description: >
    This paper delves deeper in the arbitration between model-free and 
    model-based approaches to reinforcement learning in humans, and 
    includes an analysis on structural brain data and how that might 
    influence decision-making.

    Computational and behavioral markers of model‐based decision making in childhood
  description: >
    This was my first paper investigating how reinforcement learning in humans across the lifespan, looks like,
    and how we decide between more "model-free" or "model-based" approaches. The paper included a lot of model-fitting
    and working with noisy data, but it's probably my favorite publication so far.

    Toward a science of effective cognitive training

    In this review paper, we tried to pinpoint the actual mechanisms that lead to effective training and intervention programs. This is
    my most cited paper 🤓

    Effects of maternal deprivation and complex housing on rat social behavior in adolescence and adulthood
  description: >
    During my masters, I was part of a Translational Neuroscience lab where we did research on the holistic interplay of drugs, environment, and stress.
    This was the first ever paper I helped contribute to, and thought me the academic process.
