- title: "Financial Literacy with Claire"
  type: "Talk"
  description: >
    I have a real passion for financial literacy, so I'm sometimes asked to present on the basics, for example for university
    students or internally at my current company. In this talk, I go over the essentials: budgeting, saving and investing. It's a 
    short and light-hearted talk about how we can start working on our financial plans

- title: "Computational modeling of goal-directed and habitual reinforcement-learning strategies"
  type: "Workshop"
  description: >
    At the Flux 2021 conference, together with one of my supervisors we taught a workshop on computational modeling to
    neuroscientists. We developed a Python tutorial with exercises and solutions, and demonstrated how we can simulate
    both model-free and model-based behaviour. The full workshop is available on my Github and is open access.
