  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    Hi, Iâ€™m Claire, a data scientist based in London. I specialize in solving business problems with machine learning and custom algorithms.<br><br>
    Before being a commercial data scientist, I had another life as a Cognitive Neuroscientist. You can have a look at my past research and publications
    in the <em>Academic Work</em> section.<br><br>
    Besides brains and data science, I'm passionate about financial literacy, literature and gaming. I'm also interested in sharing experiences and speaking opportunities, 
    so my goal for 2025 is to enagage in more public speaking events.<br><br>
    Get in touch if there is anything I could help you with!
